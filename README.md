# Homework2

This project was very important to me, teaching me how to adjust my website
for multiple devices, grid layouts, and bootstrap. 

I wanted to express myself in this project, and while I didn't have much time on this one, I want to make bigger and better websites.

My site has a short bio, a portfolio of my two other uploaded works, and a contact page.
